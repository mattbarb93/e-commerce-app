# e-commerce-app

## To open the project

Run the following commands:
- npm install
- npm run dev

## Languages used

This project was done in Javascript, and the styles are in regular CSS. We use NPM to get the dependencies.

## Dependencies in the project

We've used express, cookie session, bodyParser, express-validator, and multer libraries.

## Project Goal

To create an eCommerce website using only Javascript techniques, and NPM libraries.

## What have I learned?

Sign in and out functionalities, and image uploads were functionalities I've never done, so tackling it in the class was a great learning experience.

The shopping cart development from the very base (both styles and functionality) has taught me a lot that I can implement in previous projects. Also, having much more practice with the req/res calls, and async functions, made me understand the methods much better.

## What struggles have I faced?

Overall the bugs with implementing a few NPM libraries in my code (specially the multer library!) threw me off a few times. The instructor was really helpful overall and made things very clear!
